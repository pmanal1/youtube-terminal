# YouTube Terminal

Also called the YouTube Command Line, it is a project meant to trim the fat of YouTube's features and turn YouTube into a text-based program. Initially meant to address the addicting features of YouTube, it provides basic search features, allows you to subscribe to certain channels, and save videos for a later time.
